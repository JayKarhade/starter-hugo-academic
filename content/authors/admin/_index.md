Hi there!

I’m a final year student at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus. I focus on applying Computer Vision and Machine Learning for varied applications ranging from AI for healthcare to Robot Perception and Robot Learning.

At the moment, I am pursuing my undergraduate thesis at the Advanced Robotics Centre,NUS where I am advised by Prof. Marcelo Ang on Neural Rendering for Point Clouds and 3D Vision problems. Alongside, I am applying few-shot learning for healthcare diagnostics. I interned at the [Edifice Lab,ASU](https://edificelab.com/) over the course of the summer for developing collaborative dense SLAM systems and Point Cloud Compression.

I am fortunate to have actively collaborated with [Dr. Rajesh Kumar Tripathy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cvw_YK8AAAAJ&hl=en), [Dr. Parikshit Sahatiya](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?user=sh_wsEEAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Dr. Alivelu Manga Parimi](https://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/hyderabad/alivelu/profile).

Do reach out to me be it for a collaboration or a simple chat.

Cheers!
